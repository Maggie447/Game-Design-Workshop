Title: Balls

Description: The goal of this game is to roll balls into each other so that all of the colorful balls either collide with the walls or reach the far side of the room. Once every ball has been destroyed by meeting either of these conditions, the player wins.

Controls: Arrow keys/WASD to move player left and right; Space to throw balls

Dev Log: For this game, I designed features involving:
  - moving the player left/right with the arrow keys/WASD
  - pressing space to launch a projectile (ball)
  - spawning balls of random colors in random locations in the scene within a specific range on the x- and z-axes
  - making the projectile break just after coming into contact with the colorful balls or reaching the end of the scene
  - making the colorful balls break when coming into contact with the walls or reaching the end of the scene
  - enabling the projectiles and colorful balls to collide with each other so the colorful balls will be pushed towards the goal

Assets: Player, balls (black, red, blue, green), walls, and floor. All assets were made by me in Maya, and color was added to them in Unity.
